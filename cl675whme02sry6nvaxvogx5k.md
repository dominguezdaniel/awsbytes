## AWS Systems Manager announces a simplified onboarding experience for Application Manager

Application Manager, a capability of [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/), announces today a simplified onboarding experience for customers. Application Manager is a central hub on AWS to create, view and operate applications from a single console. With Application Manager, customers can discover and manage their resources across multiple AWS services like AWS CloudFormation, AWS Launch Wizard, AWS Service Catalog App Registry, AWS Resource Groups, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Using this feature, IT professionals can now follow a guided low-touch process to setup the Application Manager dashboards.

Application Manager allows customers to monitor their application’s operational status based on AWS CloudWatch alarms, the compliance status based on AWS Config, and the application cost using AWS Cost Explorer. With this new feature, customers who have not yet enabled these AWS services can now follow a guided setup process from within the Application Manager console. Customers without CloudWatch alarms benefit from a 1-click setup by clicking the “Auto-enable application monitoring” button to create a best-practice monitoring setup. Customers who do not use AWS Config can fill two simple forms to enable compliance tracking. Customers without cost allocation tags enabled can click “Activate application tags” for Application Manager to configure cost tagging on their behalf.

This new feature is available in all [AWS Regions where Systems Manager is offered](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) (excluding the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, AWS China (Beijing) region, operated by Sinnet and AWS China (Ningxia) region, operated by NWCD). Compliance view is not supported in the following regions: Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Europe (Milan), Middle East (Bahrain).
