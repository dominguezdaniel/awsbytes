# Announcing new AWS Amplify Library for Swift, now with support for both iOS and macOS

AWS announces the general availability of Amplify Library for Swift (previously Amplify iOS)! This release allows Swift developers to easily build cloud-connected iOS apps. Since its Developer Preview release in April 2022, we have re-written our APIs to support idiomatic Swift features like async/await that makes it easier for developers to implement structured concurrency. We also want to take this opportunity to introduce beta availability of macOS support--one of our most requested features--with watchOS and tvOS support coming in future releases. As with the Preview, the Amplify Library for Swift is open source on GitHub, and we deeply appreciate the feedback we have gotten from the community.

Starting today, developers can use Amplify Library for Swift via the Swift Package Manager to build apps for iOS and macOS (currently in beta) platforms with Auth, Storage, Geo and more features. Developers will continue to have access to the same Command Line Interface (CLI) tools to configure and manage their cloud resources. With the Amplify Library for Swift, you will also have direct access to the underlying AWS SDK for Swift through the escape hatch to unlock additional capabilities from AWS services.
