## The Debut of Cryptocurrencies in the Super Bowl 2022

The crypto companies are preparing their commercials for the familiarization of millions of users for the next Super Bowl 2022 where the Angels Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals face each other.

Super Bowl 2022 comes as the cryptocurrency industry has been investing heavily in educating consumers to feel more comfortable and confident trading and investing in this new industry.

Some of the crypto companies that will be present at Super Bowl 2022 are Coinbase, FTX and Crypto.com, which are betting to attract more users. The game on Feb. 13 marks the first time a cryptocurrency brand has entered America's most famous sporting event, which drew 96.4 million viewers across all platforms based on data from last year.

The cryptocurrency sector is new to sports sponsorships but spends more annually than airlines, quick-service restaurants and wine and spirits companies, according to IEG, a sponsorship consulting firm. IEG expects spending by crypto companies on sports sponsorships in the United States to total more than $160 million this year.

For example, Crypto.com has posted ads on Formula 1 racing, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and professional basketball. Last fall, he reached a 20-year, $700 million deal for the naming rights to Los Angeles' Staples Center. His recent ad campaign stars actor Matt Damon.

For its part, FTX has reached agreements with teams from the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball, and with players like Stephen Curry. In March 2021, he paid $135 million to buy the naming rights to the Heat's stadium in Miami.

As crypto companies increase their advertising spend, brands have launched crypto-themed campaigns and marketing strategies to take advantage of the buzz surrounding this new industry.

Finally, another notable aspect for this Super Bowl is that game attendees will get commemorative NFL NFT tickets, which in a partnership with Ticketmaster allow fans to have "a digital keepsake of their 2022 Super Bowl experience."
