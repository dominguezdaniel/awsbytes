## Announcing the general availability of AWS Cloud WAN

AWS announced the general availability of AWS Cloud WAN, a wide area networking (WAN) service that helps you build, manage, and monitor a unified global network. The service manages traffic running between your AWS resources and your on-premises environments.

With Cloud WAN, you can use a central dashboard and network policies to create a global network that spans multiple locations and networksâ€”removing the need to configure and manage different networks individually by using different technologies. You can use your network policies to specify which of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds, AWS Transit Gateways, and on-premises locations you want to connect to by using an AWS Site-to-Site VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or third-party software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) products. The Cloud WAN central dashboard generates a complete view of the network to help you monitor network health, security, and performance. Cloud WAN automatically creates a global network across AWS Regions by using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) so that you can easily exchange routes around the world.

Cloud WAN is available in the following [AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/): US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Milan), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), and Middle East (Bahrain).
