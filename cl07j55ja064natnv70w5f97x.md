## What is Layer 1 in Blockchain?

Layer-1 blockchains can validate and finalize transactions without the need for another network. Making improvements to the scalability of layer-1 networks is difficult, as we’ve seen with Bitcoin. As a solution, developers create layer-2 protocols that rely on the layer-1 network for security and consensus. Bitcoin's Lightning Network is one example of a layer-2 protocol. It allows users to make transactions freely before recording them into the main chain.

Layer 1 and layer 2 are terms that help us understand the architecture of different blockchains, projects, and development tools. If you've ever wondered about the relationship between Polygon and Ethereum or Polkadot and its parachains, learning about the different blockchain layers will help.

A layer-1 network is another name for a base blockchain. BNB Smart Chain (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Solana are all layer-1 protocols. We refer to them as layer-1 because these are the main networks within their ecosystem. In contrast to layer-1, we have off-chains and other layer-2 solutions that are built on top of the main chains.

In other words, a protocol is layer 1 when it processes and finalizes transactions on its own blockchain. They also have their own native token, used to pay for transaction fees.

Today’s blockchain ecosystem has several layer-1 networks and layer-2 protocols. It’s easy to get confused, but as soon as you grasp the basic concepts, it becomes easier to understand the overall structure and architecture. This knowledge can be useful when studying new blockchain projects, especially when they focus on network interoperability and cross-chain solutions.
