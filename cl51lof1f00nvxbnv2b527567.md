## AWS DataSync can now copy data to and from Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

[AWS DataSync](https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/) now supports copying files to and from [Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/netapp-ontap/), a storage service that allows customers to launch and run fully managed ONTAP file systems in the cloud. Using AWS DataSync, you can quickly and securely migrate your data from your on-premises storage, the edge, or other clouds to your FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems running in AWS. You can also use DataSync to move data between your FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system and Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon EFS file systems, or other Amazon FSx file systems.

AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that makes it easy to move petabytes of data between on-premises storage, edge locations, or other cloud providers, and AWS Storage services. It uses a purpose-built network protocol and scale-out architecture to accelerate data movement and provides encryption of data in-transit and at-rest, along with end-to-end data integrity verification. DataSync provides control and monitoring capabilities such as data transfer scheduling and include and exclude filters, and gives you granular visibility into the transfer process through Amazon CloudWatch metrics, logs, and events.

FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides the same familiar features, performance, and administrative capabilities that NetApp customers use on premises, with the simplicity, agility, security, and scalability of a fully managed and native AWS service. DataSync securely and seamlessly connects to your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, and copies files and folders together with their associated metadata. With this launch, DataSync now supports all Amazon FSx file system types: FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for Lustre, FSx for OpenZFS, and FSx for ONTAP.
