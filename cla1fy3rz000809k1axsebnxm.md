# AWS Migration Hub Orchestrator now supports Microsoft SQL Server migration

AWS Migration Hub Orchestrator adds support for Microsoft SQL Server to help you simplify and accelerate SQL Server database migration to AWS. You can now easily create a SQL Server migration workflow, automate the manual tasks involved in the migration, and track the migration progress in the same console. With this capability, you can reduce SQL Server migration time and effort to avoid schedule and cost overruns.

AWS Migration Hub Orchestrator helps you optimize and scale your application migrations from start to finish with workflow templates. Now, Migration Hub Orchestrator allows you to rehost SQL Server to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and replatform SQL Server to Relational Database Service (RDS) using native backup and restore with AWS prescribed workflow templates. You can choose a SQL Server workflow template based on your needs, create a migration workflow, backup on-premises SQL Server databases to Amazon S3, and restore to EC2 or RDS. You can also customize the migration workflow by adding, reordering, and removing steps per specific needs like inserting an additional approval step for cutover. During migration, Migration Hub Orchestrator automates the manual tasks using various tools and scripts, manages dependencies across different steps, and orchestrates the migration workflow in one place.

You can now use the new feature in all AWS Regions where AWS Migration Hub is available. This new feature is available to you at no additional cost. You only pay for the AWS resources that you provision for migration. To learn more about AWS Migration Hub Orchestrator, see the user guide.
