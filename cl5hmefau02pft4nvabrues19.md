## AWS Security Hub adds four new integration partners

[AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/?aws-security-hub-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&aws-security-hub-blogs.sort-order=desc) has added four new integration partners to help customers with their cloud security posture monitoring. Integrations from [Lacework](https://www.lacework.com/platform/aws/), Juniper Networks, [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/sentinelone-for-aws/), and K9 Security bring Security Hub to 79 integrations. Lacework sends findings from their Polygraph Data Platform (PDP) to Security Hub to help manage AWS posture and compliance events. Juniper [Networks' vSRX Virtual Next Generation Firewall](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/vsrx/vsrx-consolidated-deployment-guide/vsrx-aws/topics/topic-map/security-aws-cloudwatch-security-hub-and-logs.html) sends security events observed by the firewall to Security Hub. SentinelOne sends security findings, identified by SentinelOne endpoints running in your AWS environment, to Security Hub. [K9 Security](https://www.k9security.io/lp/operationalize-aws-iam-security-hub) sends findings to Security Hub related to important access changes within your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration.

Security Hub is [available globally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-regions.html) and is designed to give you a comprehensive view of your security posture across your AWS accounts. With Security Hub, you now have a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, including Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager, AWS Config, AWS Health, AWS IAM Access Analyzer, as well as from over [65 AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/). You can also continuously monitor your environment using automated security checks based on standards, such as [AWS Foundational Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp.html), the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In addition, you can take action on these findings by investigating findings in Amazon Detective or AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter or by sending them to AWS Audit Manager or AWS Chatbot. You can also use Amazon EventBridge rules to send the findings to ticketing, chat, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), response and remediation workflows, and incident management tools.

You can start your 30-day free trial of Security Hub with a single click in the AWS Management Console.
