## Twitter Adds Ethereum Wallet to Tipping Feature

Twitter is now adding Ethereum wallet support for its users to tip their favorite creators. This development comes after the micro-blogging platform added Bitcoin tips in September.

Twitter Tips first launched in September 2021. It allows users to link their payment details for third-party services such as Venmo or Cash App. Anyone so inclined can pay a Twitter user for their insights. Twitter account holders who want to tip in BTC directly can also copy and paste another user's BTC address into their own wallet serviceâ€”or tip directly via the Strike wallet.

Users looking to receive ETH tips simply need to enable the platform's tipping features and add an Ethereum address to the dedicated section of their profile. However, an attempt to add an ENS domain name in place of a full alphanumeric address proved unsuccessful, prompting an error box that indicated punctuation was invalid.

Recently, Twitter rolled out a feature that allows Twitter Blue users to upload NFTs, as their profile pictures.
