# AWS CloudTrail Lake now supports export of signed query results to Amazon S3

AWS CloudTrail Lake now allows you to export signed query results from Lake to a specified Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. This feature lets you integrate CloudTrail Lake with your downstream workflows for further analysis and visualization purposes, such as query join operations with data sets in Amazon Athena, and dashboards with Amazon QuickSight. Every query result file exported from CloudTrail Lake includes a CloudTrail signature. This signature file, designed to provide security assurance, can help verify any unauthorized modifications to the data exported from CloudTrail Lake.

Users can specify the S3 bucket location to which they want to export specific query results in the CloudTrail Lake query editor console, or by using the CLI or API. When you run queries in Lake, you incur charges based on the amount of data scanned by the query. There are no additional CloudTrail Lake charges for exporting query results to S3 buckets. Amazon S3 storage charges apply.

This feature is made available in the following commercial regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), South America (Sao Paulo), Europe (Milan), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Middle East (Bahrain), Middle East (Dubai) and South Africa (Cape Town).
