## AWS Fault Injection Simulator now supports ChaosMesh and Litmus experiments

[AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) now supports [ChaosMesh](https://chaos-mesh.org/) and [Litmus](https://litmuschaos.io/) experiments for containerized applications running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Using the new Kubernetes custom resource action for AWS FIS, you can control ChaosMesh and Litmus chaos experiments from within an AWS FIS experiment, enabling you to coordinate fault injection workflows among multiple tools. For example, you can run a stress test on a podâ€™s CPU using ChaosMesh or Litmus faults while terminating a randomly selected percentage of cluster nodes using AWS FIS fault actions.

To get started running ChaosMesh and Litmus chaos experiments from AWS FIS, simply log in to [AWS FIS in the AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/fis) and start creating a new experiment template. Next, select the [aws:eks:inject-kubernetes-custom-resource action type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/fis-actions-reference.html#inject-kubernetes-custom-resource) and provide the Kubernetes parameters such as API version, namespace, and custom resource details. Then, specify the EKS cluster you want to target. Because AWS FIS is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS, you can also apply IAM permissions to manage which users and roles can start experiments, set Amazon CloudWatch alarms to stop an experiment automatically if a predefined threshold is met, and write experiment outputs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or S3 buckets.

To learn more, visit Amazon [EKS actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/fis-actions-reference.html#eks-actions-reference) in the AWS FIS User Guide and check out the [example template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/experiment-template-example.html#stress-test) for running a pod CPU stress test.
