## Announcing bare metal support for Amazon EKS Anywhere

AWS announced the general availability of [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/) Anywhere on bare metal which gives customers broader choice of infrastructure for running Kubernetes on-premises. As customers modernize their applications, they want to use Kubernetes consistently between their existing on-premises bare metal infrastructure and the cloud. Running Kubernetes on bare metal infrastructure is complex, and customers spend time, effort and money on infrastructure operations instead of focusing on business innovation.

Amazon EKS Anywhere on bare metal enables customers to automate all steps from bare metal hardware provisioning to Kubernetes cluster operations using a bundled open source toolset built on the foundation of Tinkerbell and Cluster API. Customers get choice of operating systems, and can pick either Bottlerocket (default) or Ubuntu for running their clusters. There are no upfront commitments or fees to use Amazon EKS Anywhere. Customers can optionally purchase Amazon [EKS Anywhere Subscriptions](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/pricing/) to get 24/7 support from AWSâ€™ highly-trained subject matter experts for Amazon EKS Anywhere cluster components as well as all bundled open source tooling.
