## Announcing VMware Cloud on AWS integration with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

AWS and VMware now offer a supplemental, jointly-engineered network file system (NFS) datastore option for VMware Cloud on AWS so you can reduce costs and accelerate your migration to the cloud. [Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/netapp-ontap/) is a fully managed service that allows you to run NetApp ONTAP filesystems on AWS. With this integration, you can attach scalable, high-performance storage, independent from your compute resources, to your VMware Cloud on the AWS Software Defined Data Center (SDDC).

Scale or burst storage-heavy data sets with the flexibility to define performance and storage requirements so you can meet your evolving storage needs without added infrastructure costs. Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP supports ONTAP's widely adopted data management capabilities such as snapshots, cloning, and replication, as well as its storage efficiency features such as deduplication and compression, which can help further reduce your storage costs.

The [VMware Cloud on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/) integration with FSx for NetApp ONTAP is available in all AWS Regions where VMware Cloud on AWS and FSx for NetApp ONTAP are available.
