## Integration of AWS Well-Architected Tool with AWS Organizations

AWS Well-Architected Tool now integrates with AWS Organizations enabling cloud architects to share their workloads and custom lenses more broadly across their organization. AWS Organizations is an account management service that allows customers to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into a single, centrally managed organization. This update will increase efficiency and make it easier to share lenses and workloads with multiple accounts.

Well-Architected customers will be able to give access to specific teams or departments by sharing their workloads and custom lenses across different subsets within an organization. This will promote collaboration between teams and will save customers time, allowing them to scale faster across a wider audience. Additionally, customers will be able to better control access to workloads and custom lenses.
