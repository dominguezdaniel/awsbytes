# Amazon SageMaker Canvas supports tags to track and allocate costs incurred by users

We are excited to announce the support of assigning tags to user-profiles created within Amazon SageMaker. This enables you to track [Amazon SageMaker Canvas](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/canvas) usage costs categorized by users, departments, lines of businesses, or cost centers.

SageMaker Canvas is a visual point-and-click interface that enables business analysts to generate accurate ML predictions on their own â€” without requiring any machine learning experience or having to write a single line of code. SageMaker Canvas makes it easy to access and combine data from a variety of sources, automatically clean data, and build ML models to generate accurate predictions with a few clicks.

User profiles are created within Amazon SageMaker domains to access applications such as SageMaker Canvas. A tag is a label defined as a key-value pair that helps organize AWS resources. Tags assigned to user profiles are now automatically propagated and applied to users who access SageMaker Canvas. You can categorize SageMaker Canvas model building and session usage costs incurred by these users in AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR). This enables you to track costs and charge them back to the appropriate department of the user.

This new capability is now available in all AWS regions where SageMaker Canvas is supported. To learn more and get started, see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-manage-cost.html) and the Canvas product page.
