## AWS Backup adds support for Amazon RDS Multi-AZ clusters

[AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/) now allows you to protect your [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Multi-AZ clusters with two readable standbys](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/). Amazon RDS Multi-AZ clusters with one primary and two readable standby database (DB) instances across three Availability Zones (AZs) is designed to provide you up to 2x faster transaction commit latency, automated failovers, and readable standby instances. Now, all of the data protection capabilities in AWS Backup including automated lifecycle management, separate backup access policies, immutable backups with [AWS Backup Vault Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vault-lock.html), and compliance monitoring with [AWS Backup Audit Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/aws-backup-audit-manager.html) are available for Amazon RDS Multi-AZ clusters.

AWS Backup is a policy-based service that provides you a fully managed experience to centralize and automate data protection of your application data spanning across AWS services for compute, database, and storage. To start protecting your RDS Multi-AZ clusters with AWS Backup, add your RDS Multi-AZ clusters to your existing backup plans or create a new backup plan specifying backup frequency, lifecycle settings, and tagging preferences and attach your RDS clusters to the newly created backup plan.
