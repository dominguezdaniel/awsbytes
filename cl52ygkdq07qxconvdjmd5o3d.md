## Amazon QuickSight launches Level Aware Calculations (LAC)

[Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) launches a suite of functions called Level Aware Calculations (LAC). The new calculation capability enables customers to specify the level of granularity that they want the window functions (in what window to partition by) or aggregate functions (at what level to group by) to be conducted. This brings flexibility and simplification for users to build some advanced calculations and powerful analyses. Without LAC, user will have to prepare pre-aggregated tables in their original data source, or run queries in the data prep phase to enable those calculations. For further details, visit [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.html).
