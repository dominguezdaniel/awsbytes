## AWS Enterprise Support launches AWS Incident Detection and Response

Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announces the general availability of AWS Incident Detection and Response, that offers AWS Enterprise Support customers proactive monitoring and incident management for their selected workloads. AWS Incident Detection and Response is designed to help you improve your operations, increase workload resiliency, and accelerate your recovery from critical incidents. AWS Incident Detection and Response leverages the proven operational, enhanced monitoring, and incident management capabilities used internally by AWS teams and externally by AWS Managed Services (AMS).

To establish a strong foundation to securely operate your workloads in the cloud, it is critical to have an observable environment that tracks the right workload metrics. AWS Incident Detection and Response begins with a review of your workloads for reliability and operational excellence. AWS experts work with you to define critical metrics and alarms that provide improved visibility into the application and infrastructure layers of your workloads, making it easy to find and prioritize issues during an incident. AWS Incident Management Engineers continuously monitor your workloads, detect critical incidents, and engage you on a call bridge with the right AWS experts to accelerate the recovery of your workloads. All incidents are managed with the highest level of severity and escalation, and AWS remains engaged until the incidents are resolved. Lessons learned from previous incidents inform improvements to response plans and workload architecture, driving a continuous improvement cycle to improve the resiliency of your workloads.

California), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Sydney), South America (SÃ£o Paulo).
