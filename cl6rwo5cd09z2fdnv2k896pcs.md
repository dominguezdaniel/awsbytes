AWS Lambda in Action is an example-driven tutorial that teaches you how to build applications that use an event-driven approach on the back end.

About the Technology

With AWS Lambda, you write your code and upload it to the AWS cloud. AWS Lambda responds to the events triggered by your application or your users, and automatically manages the underlying computer resources for you. Back-end tasks like analyzing a new document or processing requests from a mobile app are easy to implement. Your application is divided into small functions, leading naturally to a reactive architecture and the adoption of microservices.

About the Book

AWS Lambda in Action is an example-driven tutorial that teaches you how to build applications that use an event-driven approach on the back-end. Starting with an overview of AWS Lambda, the book moves on to show you common examples and patterns that you can use to call Lambda functions from a web page or a mobile app. The second part of the book puts these smaller examples together to build larger applications. By the end, you'll be ready to create applications that take advantage of the high availability, security, performance, and scalability of AWS.
