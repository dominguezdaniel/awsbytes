## AWS IoT Device Management Fleet Indexing now supports two additional data sources

[AWS IoT Device Management Fleet Indexing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-indexing.html) now provides integration with two additional data sources, AWS IoT Core named shadows and AWS IoT Device Defender detect violations. Customers can now select specific named shadows to index only the data that is required for search queries. Also, detected violations can be indexed to target devices for troubleshooting or monitor the fleet-level anomalies trends with Fleet Metrics. These two additional data sources will help IoT customers who store IoT fleet data across different services and systems and regularly access the data for fleet monitoring, health checks, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and troubleshooting. With this release, supported data sources for Fleet Indexing increased to 5 from 3 (AWS IoT Core registry, shadows, and connectivity lifecycle events).

Now, customers have more data source flexibility when monitoring and managing their devices from Fleet Indexing or from [AWS IoT Device Management Fleet Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/fleethubuserguide/what-is-aws-iot-monitor.html). Customers can now set fleet metric alarms, perform queries, or target devices in their fleet with additional device state and behavior anomaly data. Moreover, the additional data sources for Fleet Indexing can help customers to focus their time and resources on high-value fleet monitoring analysis and troubleshooting and less time on building and maintaining DIY fleet management solutions.

The two additional data sources are available today in all regions [where AWS IoT Device Management is available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) except AWS IoT Device Defender is not available in South America (SÃ£o Paulo) region. For more information, see the [Fleet Indexing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-indexing.html) and [Fleet Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/fleethubuserguide/what-is-aws-iot-monitor.html) developer guide.
