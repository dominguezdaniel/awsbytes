## AWS Application Migration Service is now in scope for AWS SOC reports

You can now use [AWS Application Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/application-migration-service/) (AWS MGN) for use cases that are subject to System and Organization Controls (SOC) reporting. You can also now install the AWS Application Migration Service agent on your source servers using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) temporary security credentials with limited permissions. AWS Application Migration Service allows you to quickly migrate and modernize applications on AWS.

[AWS SOC reports](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/) are independent third-party examination reports that demonstrate how AWS achieves key compliance controls and objectives. In addition to meeting standards for SOC, AWS Application Migration Service is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) eligible, Payment Card Industry â€“ Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) compliant. You can download the AWS SOC reports in [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/), and you can visit [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) to see a full list of services covered by each compliance program.
