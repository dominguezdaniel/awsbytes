## Announcing preview of AWS DataSync Discovery

AWS announces the public preview of [AWS DataSync Discovery](https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/discovery/). You can use DataSync Discovery to gain visibility into your on-premises storage performance and utilization, and receive automated recommendations to help simplify and accelerate your data migration to AWS. This new feature of AWS DataSync enables you to better understand your on-premises storage usage through automated data collection and analysis, quickly identify data to migrate, and evaluate recommended AWS Storage services for your data, such as [Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/netapp-ontap/), Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, and [Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/).

You can get started by configuring DataSync Discovery to connect to your on-premises storage and then run discovery jobs to collect information about your storage system, including performance, capacity, and utilization metrics. While your discovery jobs run, you can view collected information in the DataSync console dashboards. When a discovery job completes, the collected data is analyzed to produce recommendations for migrating to AWS Storage services. These recommendations can guide your selection of AWS Storage services and you can use AWS DataSync to move your data to your selected storage service. DataSync Discovery gives you a fully managed discovery and recommendation capability for on-premises storage systems, minimizing the time, effort, and costs associated with planning and executing data migrations to AWS.

AWS DataSync Discovery (Preview) is available in the US East (N. Virginia) Region at no additional cost and supports recommendations for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) during the preview. Support for additional AWS Storage services, such as Amazon S3, will be added as part of general availability (GA).
