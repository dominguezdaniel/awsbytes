## AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript is now generally available

 On: Jul 15, 2022

AWS announced the general availability of [AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/), an open-source developer library to help you incorporate [Well-Architected Serverless best practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-well-architected-serverless-applications-introduction/) into your Lambda function code as early and as fast as possible.

In this release, Lambda Powertools for TypeScript focuses on three observability features: distributed tracing (Tracer), structured logging (Logger), and asynchronous business and application metrics (Metrics). Developers can use Lambda Powertools for TypeScript to adopt these practices in mere seconds. By providing abstractions on top of the AWS SDK and multiple AWS services, Powertools increases developer's productivity by streamlining the adoption of best practices defined in the [AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-serverless-lens-in-aws-well-architected-tool/).

Lambda Powertools for TypeScript is used when developing code for Lambdaâ€™s Node.js runtimes. These runtimes are available in all [Regions where Lambda is available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/). Powertools is also available in the [Python](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/latest/) and [Java](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-java/) programming languages.
