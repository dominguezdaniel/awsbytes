## Energy-Efficient Blockchain Systems

While Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum all depend on energy-inefficient cryptographic problem solving known as “proof of work” to operate, many newer blockchains use “proof-of-stake” (PoS) systems that rely on market incentives. 

Server owners on PoS systems are called “validators”—not “miners.” They put down a deposit, or “stake,” a large amount of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the right to add blocks to the blockchain. In proof-of-work systems, miners compete with each other to see who can solve problems the fastest in exchange for a reward, taking up a large amount of energy. But in PoS systems, validators are chosen by an algorithm that takes their stake into account. Removing the element of competition saves energy and allows each machine in a PoS system to work on one problem at a time, as opposed to a proof-of-work system, in which a plethora of machines are rushing to solve the same problem. Additionally, if a validator fails to behave honestly, they may be removed from the network—which helps keep PoS systems accurate.

Particularly promising is the delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS) system, which operates somewhat like a representative democracy. In DPoS systems, everyone who has cryptocurrency tokens can vote on which servers become block producers and manage the blockchain as a whole. However, there is one downside. DPoS is somewhat less censorship resistant than proof-of-work systems. Because it only has 21 block producers, in theory, the network could be brought to a stop by simultaneous subpoenas or cease and desist orders, making it more vulnerable to the thousands upon thousands of nodes on Ethereum. But DPoS has proven to be vastly faster at processing transactions while using less energy, and that’s a trade-off we in the industry should be willing to make.

Among the largest cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is already working on a transition to PoS, and we should take more collective action to hasten this movement. Developers need to think long and hard before creating new proof-of-work blockchains, because the more successful they become, the worse the ecological impact they may have.

Imagine if car companies had been wise enough, several decades ago, to come together and set emission standards for themselves. It would have helped cultivate a healthier planet—and preempted billions of dollars in costs when those standards were finally imposed on them.

The blockchain industry is now at a similar inflection point. The question is whether we’ll be wiser than the world-changing industries that came before us.
