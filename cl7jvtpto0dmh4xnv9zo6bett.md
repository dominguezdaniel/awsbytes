## AWS SAM CLI esbuild support is now generally available

The [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) Command Line Interface (CLI) announces general availability of esbuild support in SAM CLI. The AWS SAM CLI is a developer tool that makes it easier to build, test, package, and deploy serverless applications. [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), “an extremely fast JavaScript bundler”, links JavaScript ( js , jsx , ts , and tsx ) and CSS dependencies as deployable assets for the web. Starting today, you can now use esbuild in the SAM CLI build workflow for your JavaScript applications.

Developers using JavaScript and TypeScript can now use esbuild and [SAM Accelerate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/accelerate.html) to rapidly iterate on their code changes in the cloud, achieving the same levels of productivity they're used to when testing locally, while testing against a realistic application environment in the cloud. Support for esbuild includes features such as Minification, Tree Shaking, Source Maps, Loader, External and Main-Fields which can help simplify AWS Lambda development with JavaScript and TypeScript.

To learn more about this feature, please read details in the documentation. To get started, you can install the SAM CLI by following the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
