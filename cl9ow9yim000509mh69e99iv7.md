# AWS DataSync adds support for self-signed certificates

[AWS DataSync](https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/) now supports the use of self-signed certificates when connecting to object storage locations via HTTPS. When configuring an object storage location, you can specify a self-signed X.509 (.pem) certificate that the DataSync agent will use to secure the TLS connection to your self-managed object storage server. With this launch, you can now configure DataSync to use secure HTTPS connections with self-managed object storage systems that do not provide certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

As a fully-managed service, DataSync removes the operational burden of online data movement, including setting up and maintaining infrastructure, building, buying and operating data transfer software, and manually executing and verifying one-time or periodic data transfers. DataSync also has built-in security capabilities such as encryption of data in-transit and at-rest and end-to-end data integrity verification. DataSync uses a purpose-built network protocol and scale-out architecture to accelerate data movement and optimize the use of your network through bandwidth throttling controls and compression of data in-transit. It also automatically recovers from temporary network issues and provides control and monitoring capabilities such as data transfer scheduling, include and exclude filters, and granular visibility into the transfer process through Amazon CloudWatch metrics, logs, and events.

You can now use self-signed certificates in all regions where AWS DataSync is available. To learn more, visit the AWS DataSync product page, view our documentation, or try DataSync in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/datasync).
