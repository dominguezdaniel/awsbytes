## Amazon Interactive Video Service now includes web broadcast SDK

Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS) web broadcast SDK gives you the ability to capture live video from web browsers and send as an input to an Amazon IVS channel. You can include it on new and existing websites, with support for both desktop and mobile web browsers.

The Amazon IVS web broadcast SDK supports the capture of multiple media sources such as built-in device cameras and microphones, screen share, as well as popular 3rd party webcams and microphones connected through audio jack, USB, and bluetooth. The SDK sends the media stream to Amazon IVS and can automatically adjust bitrate in response to fluctuating network conditions.

Using the Amazon IVS web broadcast SDK incurs no additional charges beyond standard Amazon IVS usage costs. To get started, see our documentation pages.

[Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/) is a managed live streaming solution that is designed to be quick and easy to set up, and ideal for creating interactive video experiences. Send your live streams to Amazon IVS using the broadcast SDKs or standard streaming software such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) and the service is designed to provide everything you need to make low-latency live video available to any viewer around the world, letting you focus on building interactive experiences alongside the live video.

Video ingest and delivery are available around the world over a managed network of infrastructure optimized for live video. Visit the [AWS region table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for a full list of AWS Regions where the Amazon IVS console and APIs for control and creation of video streams are available.
