## AWS Backup Audit Manager adds new control to audit recovery point objective (RPO)

[AWS Backup Audit Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/faqs/) a new control that you can use to audit and report on the recovery point objective (RPO) of your backups. With this launch, you can now specify your organizational recovery point objectives for your resources and evaluate whether your recovery points are in compliance.

To begin using this new AWS Backup Audit Manager control, simply enable it in your existing [AWS Backup Audit Manager frameworks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/working-with-audit-frameworks.html). Once you enable this control, AWS Backup Audit Manager automatically runs it on a daily basis, monitoring your RPOs based on your data protection policies, and alerts you to take corrective actions, if needed. You can also generate auditor-ready reports to help prove compliance of your data protection policies with your defined industry-specific regulatory requirements.
