## AWS Elemental MediaLive adds encoding for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision

If you deliver experiences with immersive audio and high dynamic range (HDR) video, you can now use [AWS Elemental MediaLive](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/) to encode [Dolby Atmos](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medialive/latest/ug/feature-dolbyatmos.html) and [Dolby Vision](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medialive/latest/ug/color-space.html) in your channel.

Dolby Atmos allows creatives control over the placement and movement of each sound, helping them create a rich and layered spatial experience. With greater precision and detail than traditional surround sound mixing, creators can fine-tune their perfect mix. Dolby Vision builds on standard HDR by capturing visual information frame by frame. The visual information is called dynamic metadata, which consistently optimizes the brightness and color information of every frame. MediaLive supports the 8.1 profile for Dolby Vision, which includes this dynamic metadata and is also compatible with HDR10.

For more information on how to enable these features, visit the MediaLive documentation for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Dolby Vision in MediaLive is available at no additional cost and Dolby Atmos encoding is available via the MediaLive Advanced Audio add-on functionality.

AWS Elemental MediaLive is a broadcast-grade live video processing service. It lets you create high-quality live video streams for delivery to broadcast televisions and internet-connected multiscreen devices, like connected TVs, tablets, smartphones, and set-top boxes.

The MediaLive service functions independently or as part of AWS Media Services, a family of services that form the foundation of cloud-based workflows and offer you the capabilities you need to transport, create, package, monetize, and deliver video.
