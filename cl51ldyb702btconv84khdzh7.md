## Amazon Polly adds new male Neural TTS voices in 4 languages

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. AWS announced the general availability of 4 male Neural TTS voices: Liam for Canadian French, Arthur for UK English, Daniel for German and Pedro for US Spanish.

TTS voices simplify the way you can create, implement, update, and maintain your speech-enabled applications and products. You can use Amazon Polly to enhance the user experience and improve the accessibility of your text content with the power of voice. Common use cases include interactive voice response (IVR) systems, audiobooks, newsreaders, eLearning content, and virtual assistants. 

All four voices have been modeled on Matthew, an existing US English voice. While customers continue to appreciate Matthew for his naturalness and professional-sounding quality, he has so far exclusively served English-speaking traffic. AWS was able to decouple language and speaker profile, which allowed to preserve native-like fluency across different languages without the necessity of obtaining multilingual data from the same speaker. As a result, AWS transferred the highly likeable vocal characteristics of Matthew to four new languages.
