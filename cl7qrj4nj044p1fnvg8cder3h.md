## AWS App Runner now supports Amazon Route 53 alias record for root domain name

AWS App Runner now supports [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) alias records for creating a root domain name. App Runner makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs to the cloud, at scale, and without having to manage infrastructure. When you create an App Runner service, by default, App Runner allocates a domain name to your service. If you have your own domain name, you can associate it to your App Runner service as a custom domain name. Now, you can use Amazon Route 53 alias record to create a root domain or subdomain for your App Runner service. For example, with alias records your App Runner service can now directly listen on example.com which was not possible with only CNAME record support which requires you to prepend a hostname such as acme.example.com.

You can create an Amazon Route 53 alias record for your target Domain Name System (DNS) directly from Amazon Route 53 console and choose Alias to App Runner Application to route web traffic to your App Runner service. To learn more about managing custom domain names for your App Runner service and configuring an Amazon Route 53 alias record, see [App Runner custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/manage-custom-domains.html) section in the developer guide.
