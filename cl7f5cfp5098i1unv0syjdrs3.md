## AWS Security Hub launches announcements notification topic

AWS Security Hub now publishes announcements through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), helping you stay up to date with the latest feature releases and announcements. To receive announcements about new AWS Security Hub features, subscribe to the [AWS Security Hub SNS topic] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-announcements.html) in your preferred Region.

You can also use an AWS Lambda function to trigger events when notifications are received. For more information, see [Invoking Lambda functions using Amazon SNS notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-lambda-as-subscriber.html).

[Available globally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-regions.html), AWS Security Hub gives you a centralized and comprehensive view of your security posture across all of your AWS accounts and across all Regions. With Security Hub, you now have a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS IAM Access Analyzer, as well as from over [65 AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/). You can also continuously monitor your environment using automated security checks based on standards, such as AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. You can also take action on these findings by investigating findings in Amazon Detective and by using Amazon CloudWatch Event rules to send the findings to ticketing, chat, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR), and incident management tools or custom remediation playbooks.

You can enable your 30-day free trial of AWS Security Hub with a single-click in the AWS Management console. Please see the AWS Regions page for all the regions where AWS Security Hub is available.
