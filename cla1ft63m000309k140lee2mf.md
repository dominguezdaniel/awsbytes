# Amazon Braket adds support for a neutral atom quantum processor named Aquila from QuEra Computing Inc.

[Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/), the quantum computing service from AWS, adds support for Aquila, a new neutral atom-based quantum processor from QuEra Computing Inc. As a special purpose device designed for solving optimization problems and the study of quantum phenomena in nature, it enables researchers in industry and academia to explore a new, analog paradigm in quantum computing.

Amazon Braket enables customers to accelerate their research in quantum computing by providing access to different types of quantum hardware. While the Aquila device is not a universal quantum computer, it is capable of a paradigm of quantum computing known as analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS), whereby users can encode a problem of interest in a mathematical object known as the Hamiltonian, and the quantum processor can simulate the dynamics of a quantum system under that Hamiltonian. With up to 256 qubits, a system size that is hard to simulate classically today, Aquila can solve for the static and dynamic properties of quantum systems of many interacting particles. Now, researchers can access and experiment with a state-of-the-art AHS device with no upfront commitments and pay-as-you-go pricing, as they can with all other quantum computers on Amazon Braket.

You can access the Aquila device from the US East (N. Virginia) region. Researchers at accredited institutions can apply for credits to support experiments on Amazon Braket through the AWS Cloud Credits for Research program.
