# Amazon DevOps Guru now provides list view for resources analyzed

You can now view and filter the list of resources analyzed by [Amazon DevOps Guru](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/) within the DevOps Guru console. You can view the list of resources on the ‘Analyzed resources’ page and sort and filter by resource name, DevOps Guru tag name (or tag value), CloudFormation stack name, or AWS Service name.

Amazon DevOps Guru is an ML-powered service that makes it easier to improve an application’s operational performance and availability. By analyzing application metrics, logs, events, and traces, DevOps Guru identifies potential abnormal behaviors that deviate from normal operating patterns and creates an insight that alerts developers with issue details. When possible, DevOps Guru also provides potential remediation recommendations sent via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), Amazon EventBridge, or partner integrations.

Click the ‘Analyzed resources’ link in the ‘System health summary’ at the top right of the Amazon DevOps Guru dashboard page.

If you use CloudFormation stacks or tags, you can view a list of resources for a specific stack or tag by clicking on the ‘Analyzed resources’ link in the cards under ‘System health overview’.
