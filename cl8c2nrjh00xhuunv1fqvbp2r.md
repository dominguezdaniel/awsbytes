## Amazon S3 on Outposts now supports object versioning

[Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/outposts/) now supports versioning, helping you to locally preserve, retrieve, and restore each version of every object stored in your buckets. Versioning objects makes it easier to recover from both unintended user actions and application failures. After you enable versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket, all variants of an object are stored in the same bucket, and are distinguishable by a versionId.

Amazon S3 on Outposts delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts rack environment to help you meet your low latency, local data processing, and data residency needs. Using the S3 APIs and features, S3 on Outposts makes it easier to store, secure, tag, retrieve, report on, and control access to the data on your Outposts. AWS Outposts rack, as part of the AWS Outposts Family, is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, and tools to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience.

Support for S3 versioning is available to S3 on Outposts customers at no additional charge, in all AWS Regions where Outposts rack is available. To learn more, visit the S3 on Outposts page, or read our [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html).
