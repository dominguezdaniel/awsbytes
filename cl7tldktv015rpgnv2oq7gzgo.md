## AWS Backup adds Amazon CloudWatch metrics to its console dashboard

AWS Backup now provides you a way to centrally view your [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) metrics for your data protection jobs directly in the AWS Backup console. With this launch, you can monitor your data protection metrics (of backup, copy, and restore jobs) for all the AWS Backup supported services, spanning compute, storage, databases, and third-party applications. To drill down to a custom view, you can add your tracked metrics to a custom CloudWatch Dashboard using the "Add to dashboard" capability.

The new integrated Amazon CloudWatch dashboard for AWS Backup is available to all customers in all AWS Regions where AWS Backup is available. To learn more about AWS Backup, visit the [AWS Backup product page](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/), [technical documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/cloudwatch.html), and pricing page.
