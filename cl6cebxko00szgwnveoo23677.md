## AWS Amplify Flutter announces web and desktop support (Developer Preview) for Authentication

AWS Amplify is announcing a developer preview to expand Flutter support to web and desktop, starting with the Authentication category. With this release, developers can use Amplify to create new Flutter apps that support web and desktop in addition to mobile platforms. Developers can also extend existing mobile Amplify Flutter projects to support web and desktop. 
With this developer preview version, developers can use a single codebase with the Amplify Authentication category to build Flutter apps that target iOS, Android, web, and desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows). Our [Authenticator UI library](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/flutter/connected-components/authenticator) has also been upgraded to support Flutter web and desktop, providing developers with a sign in/sign up experience that works across iOS, Android, web, and desktop with minimal configurations. We will be expanding web and desktop support for the rest of Amplify Flutter categories in future releases.

Get started with building Flutter cross-platform apps with [Amplify Flutter](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/flutter/).
