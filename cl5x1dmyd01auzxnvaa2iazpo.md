## Combined OU and Accounts page now available in AWS Control Tower

AWS announce the new Organization page in AWS Control Tower with a hierarchical view of all Organizational units (OUs) and accounts. Customers now have the ability to view, group, and manage their entire organizational structure through a single page.

With this new structure, customers are able to quickly understand relationships between their parent and nested OUs and accounts, and more easily take action on groupings of resources. You have the flexibility of configuring the page view for optimal discoverability including expanding or collapsing the hierarchical view, isolating accounts or OUs only, viewing only enrolled/registered accounts and OUs, and grouping related resources.

When you need to take action on an account or OU, there’s no longer a need to visit separate pages. You can now go to one central location to view state and status, and take actions on all of your accounts and OUs. As a result, you can more easily ensure that your organization is updated and enrolled.

AWS Control Tower offers a streamlined way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. Customers will create new accounts using AWS Control Tower’s account factory and enable governance features such as guardrails, centralized logging and monitoring in supported AWS Regions.
