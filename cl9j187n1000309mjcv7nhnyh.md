# Amazon S3 on Outposts now supports Access Point aliases to simplify application access to data

Amazon S3 on Outposts now supports Access Point aliases to simplify application access to data. Beginning today, you can configure applications to use the Access Point alias in place of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when accessing S3 on Outposts buckets. With Access Points, you can create hundreds of unique policies to control access to shared datasets, and applications can access S3 on Outposts buckets by utilizing this alias. Amazon S3 on Outposts Access Point aliases are now available in all AWS Regions where AWS Outposts are available at no additional cost.

Every time you create an Access Point for a bucket, S3 on Outposts automatically generates an Access Point alias which is interchangeable with the ARN anywhere you use an ARN for data access. For existing S3 on Outposts Access Points, aliases have been automatically assigned and are ready for use, with no additional steps required. You can use an Access Point alias to perform object-level operations such as PUT, GET, LIST, and more. Multiple Access Points can be created for a single bucket, each with its own access policy, helping you easily build the right access controls to shared datasets. For example, you can create access points with tailored read or write access for each team within the organization, or limit access to a bucket through access points that are restricted to a VPC.

You can create Access Points on all S3 on Outposts buckets through the [S3 Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/), AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), the Application Programming Interface (API), and the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) client. Corresponding S3 on Outposts Access Point aliases are automatically generated. S3 on Outposts Access Point aliases are available using the latest version of the SDK/CLI in all AWS Regions where S3 on Outposts is supported, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, at no additional cost.
