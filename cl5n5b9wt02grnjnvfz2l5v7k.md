## Amazon Connect Customer Profiles now enables you to integrate unified customer information into your custom agent applications

[Amazon Connect Customer Profiles](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/customer-profiles/) now provides a JavaScript library ([CustomerProfilesJS](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-customer-profiles)) to integrate Customer Profiles into your homegrown or third-party agent application, equipping your contact center agents with the customer information they need to provide more personalized customer service. Amazon Connect Customer Profiles makes it easier for you to provide agents with quick access to unified customer data by combining contact history from Amazon Connect with data from disparate third-party applications (e.g., CRMs) and homegrown systems, leveraging machine learning based identity resolution to create a single, unified profile for each of your customers. 

With Amazon Connect Customer Profiles, companies can access customer contact history for free. Companies can also bring in customer data from multiple SaaS applications and databases, and pay only for what they use based on the number of [customer profiles](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/). Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).
