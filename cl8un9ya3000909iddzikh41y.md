## Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now supports two new CloudWatch metrics to measure and track network address usage

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) has introduced two new networking metrics; 1) Network Address Usage and 2) Peered Network Address Usage. These new metrics will help network administrators plan for expansion of their VPC architecture while proactively managing service quotas.

As one of AWS's foundational services, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define. Each resource in a VPC uses one or more network addresses to communicate with other resources within and across VPCs. With these metrics, you can now monitor the Network Address Usage in your VPCs and set alarms in CloudWatch. You can also plan for your growth by either requesting more quota in Service Quotas or create a new VPC for additional resources. Each VPC can grow up to 256,000 network addresses in a single VPC and 512,000 network addresses when peered within a region.

The Network Address Usage and Peered Network Address Usage CloudWatch metrics are available in following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia) , US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Milan), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Middle East (Bahrain), The Network Address Usage and Peered Network Address Usage CloudWatch metrics are available in following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N.
