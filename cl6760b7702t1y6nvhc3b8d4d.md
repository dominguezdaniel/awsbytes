## Amazon Nimble Studio now supports EC2 G3 and G5 instances for virtual workstations

Amazon Nimble Studio adds support for on-demand Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) G3 and G5 instances, allowing customers to utilize additional GPU instance types for their creative projects. Artists depend on a mix of CPUs, RAM, and GPUs for their their creative needs. You can now access additional instance types such as the EC2 G3 and G5 instances (EC2 G5 instances utilize the NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU), providing Nimble Studio customers greater flexibility to use the right resources for the project.

Studio admins can now grant access to additional instance types through Nimble Studio Launch Profiles, providing control over which instance types artists can use. Launch Profiles are then shared with artists, giving them a seamless experience in the Nimble Studio portal that now includes G3 and G5 instance types. EC2 G3 and G5 instance availability is dependent on EC2 on-demand capacity in the regions where Nimble Studio is also available.

Amazon Nimble Studio support for on-demand EC2 instances is available today in the major media and entertainment markets.
