## Amazon QuickSight launches rolling date functionality

[Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) now enables authors to setup rolling date to dynamically generate dashboard for end users. The rolling date functionality is now available for both date & time range filters and datetime parameters. Users will be able to set up rolling rules to fetch a date, such as today, yesterday, or different combinations of (start/end) of (this/previous/next) (year/quarter/month/week/day) and dynamically update the dashboard content based on when the dashboard is loaded. This feature brings flexibility and simplicity for users to build time-related dashboards. Without rolling date, users have to set up a static date and manually change it as needed.

The new rolling date functionality is available in Amazon QuickSight Standard and Enterprise Editions in all QuickSight regions - US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), SÃ£o Paulo, Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland and London), Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo), and AWS GovCloud (US-West).
