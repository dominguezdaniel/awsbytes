## AWS Database Migration Service now supports VPC source and target endpoints

[AWS Database Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) (AWS DMS) now supports virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints as sources and targets. AWS DMS can now connect to any AWS service with VPC endpoints so long as explicitly defined routes to the services are defined in their AWS DMS VPC.

By supporting AWS VPC endpoints AWS DMS makes it easier to maintain end to end network security for replications without the additional networking configuration and setup that was previously required to do replications on VPCs. Customers can now take advantage of the end to end security capabilities of AWS VPCs when using AWS DMS.
