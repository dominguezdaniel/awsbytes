# RStudio on Amazon SageMaker now comes with new developer productivity and security capabilities

[RStudio on Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/rstudio/) now comes with the new RStudio Workbench version 2022.02.2-485.pro2 with enhanced developer productivity and security capabilities. The [new capabilities](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/) include an enhanced R help system, improved editor support for the R pipe-bind placeholder and full end-to-end encryption that secures communication between the RStudioServerPro and RSession applications.

[RStudio on Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-fully-managed-rstudio-on-amazon-sagemaker-for-data-scientists/) is the industryâ€™s first fully managed, cloud-based RStudio Workbench. Data scientists and developers can launch the familiar RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) in a single click to build, train, and deploy models on Amazon SageMaker. You can elastically dial up and down the underlying compute resources without interrupting your work, and even switch to programming using Python on [Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks.html).

You will automatically get the updated RStudio Workbench version 2022.02.2-485.pro2 when you create a new SageMaker domain with RStudio enabled. If you have an existing domain, you will need to restart RStudio to get the new version. For detailed instructions on how to upgrade your existing RStudio on Amazon SageMaker environment, visit our related [documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/rstudio-shutdown.html). 

The new version is now available in all AWS regions where RStudio on Amazon SageMaker is [available](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/regions-quotas.html).
