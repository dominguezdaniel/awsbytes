## AWS IoT SiteWise now supports payload compression for data ingestion

AWS IoT SiteWise now supports payload compression for data ingested using the AWS IoT SiteWise data ingestion API [(BatchPutAssetPropertyValue)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_BatchPutAssetPropertyValue.html). By using payload compression industrial customers can reduce payload size and optimize network bandwidth used in order to ingest data to AWS IoT SiteWise.

The payload compression feature is enabled by default for new AWS IoT SiteWise publisher configurations. Existing customers can opt into the feature by updating their AWS IoT SiteWise publisher version of the gateway. Once the feature is enabled, the AWS IoT SiteWise ingestion API will compress payload in AWS IoT SiteWise gateway in GZIP format. 
AWS IoT SiteWise is a managed service that enables customers to collect, store, organize and monitor data from industrial equipment at scale.
