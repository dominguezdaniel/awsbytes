## AppFlow now supports deleting records in Salesforce

[Amazon AppFlow](https://aws.amazon.com/appflow/), a fully managed integration service that helps customers to securely transfer data between AWS services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications in just a few clicks, now supports deleting records in [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/). Customers of Amazon AppFlow may now execute Amazon Appflow flows which delete targeted records in a destination Salesforce instance. This new capability enhances Amazon AppFlow’s connector for Salesforce which already supports write methods such as Insert, Update, and Upsert.

Customers can now use this capability to maintain sync between Salesforce and a data source within AWS or one of Amazon AppFlow’s many other flow sources. Additionally, customers can use this Delete functionality to perform data lifecycle tasks such as deleting records as they exit a retention period.

Amazon AppFlow makes it easy for customers to configure data transfers with Salesforce in just a few clicks. To learn more about how to use this connectors and others, please visit the [Amazon AppFlow user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/salesforce.html).
