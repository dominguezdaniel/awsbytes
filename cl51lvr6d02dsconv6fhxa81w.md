## Amazon GameLift launches new console experience

[Amazon GameLift](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/) now offers a new console experience that provides a more intuitive way to manage and scale your game servers on AWS. The redesigned console has new left-hand navigation that makes it easy to switch between various GameLift features such as managing and creating builds, scripts, fleets, FlexMatch, and includes helpful resource links like “Prepare to launch”, and service quotas. The new interface will make it quicker and easier to configure and manage your game server instances by providing a view of all your settings in one location.

Amazon GameLift has also extended the integration into Amazon CloudWatch so customers can create their own dashboards and custom views of GameLift resources. The CloudWatch integration now includes metrics previously only available in the console, including aggregate metrics for instance performance, utilization/capacity, and player sessions. This gives more flexibility and choice when it comes to managing and monitoring the performance of your GameLift resources.

Additionally, the Amazon GameLift product page has been updated with a new “How it Works” architecture diagram, links to helpful resources like the Cost Calculator, getting started guides, and quick access to support links including service documentation, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and AWS re:Post forums.

Amazon GameLift is a dedicated game server hosting solution that deploys, operates, and scales cloud servers for multiplayer games. Whether you’re looking for a fully managed solution, or just the feature you need, GameLift leverages the power of AWS to deliver low latency gaming experiences, low player wait times, and cost savings.

To experience the new user interface, visit the [Amazon GameLift console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift) where you can opt-in to the new experience. Customers can choose to revert back to the old experience, or switch between the two experiences. The console is available today in all AWS Regions except AWS China Regions.
