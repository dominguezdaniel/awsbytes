## Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle now supports Scale Compute

[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Custom](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/custom/) for Oracle now supports Scale Compute operation. With this, you can now scale your Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle instance up or down.

Amazon RDS Custom is a managed database service for legacy, custom, and packaged applications that require access to the underlying operating system and database environment. To create an Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance, you start by building a custom engine version (CEV) by supplying your own database installation media files for a given version. You can create a CEV by choosing the ‘Create’ operation under Custom engine version menu in [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds) or by using the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (AWS CLI).
