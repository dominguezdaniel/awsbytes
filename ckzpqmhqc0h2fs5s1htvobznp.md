## Whatâ€™s your Metaverse Strategy?

The elements of a new digital age are converging at scale. The metaverse is the driving force bringing these elements together in a unified, immersive experience.

In the metaverse, some of the existing services and business models we are familiar with will continue to exist, but the metaverse opens a whole new realm of ways to engage which we expect will lead to uniquely new services and business models. 

Not everything in the metaverse will be relevant for every business. However, there is little downside to taking the opportunity to explore.

- Learn: There are many different interpretations of the metaverse, and various angles to learn about beyond the content here.

- Assess: While the metaverse will scale across many industry verticals, evaluate if there are relevant opportunities for your business.

- Create: Gain experience through internal development. Take the opportunity to explore creative consumer engagement through new channels, services, experiences, digital goods and assets. Start small and move fast. Test and learn.

- Connect: Start building a network of metaverse ecosystem participants. The world is still small, so high quality collaborations and partnerships are still available at a reasonable level of investment. Connect with a new generation and tap into alternative talent pools.

- Establish: Get your business out there and position yourself to capture the hearts and minds of tech-forward sub-communities.

The components of the metaverse continue to evolve very quickly. It is difficult to base  business strategy on such a dynamic space, characterized by explosive growth and the continuous innovation of new entrants. 

However, the costs and risks of engaging early and consistently in order to build internal intellectual property, develop hypotheses about future business models, and identify ecosystem partners and collaborators are relatively low. 

The asymmetrical risk of being left behind is worth the incremental investment needed to get started and to explore this new digital landscape for yourself.
