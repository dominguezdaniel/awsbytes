## AWS CloudFormation event notifications with Amazon EventBridge help you create event-driven applications

Changes to [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)-based stacks and resources are now available as event notifications in [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). Customers can use these event notifications to build and scale loosely-coupled event-driven applications. With this feature, customers can trigger actions in real-time after they create, update, or delete either their CloudFormation stacks or resources in their CloudFormation stacks without having to write single-use custom code or develop new software.

Over one million customers use AWS CloudFormation every week to model, provision, and manage their cloud applications and infrastructure in a safe, predictable, and repeatable way. Customers use EventBridge to create scalable event-driven applications by routing events between their applications, third-party SaaS applications, and other AWS services. Now, customers do not need to periodically poll for changes to their CloudFormation stacks to create event-driven applications. Customers can avoid writing custom code for polling and save compute cost for cases when polling returns empty results. CloudFormation provides three event notification types in EventBridge, including CloudFormation Resource status change, [CloudFormation Stack status change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks-event-bridge.html), and CloudFormation Drift Detection status change. Customers can create rules in EventBridge for these event notifications that will immediately trigger more than 20 targets, including AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and AWS Step Functions. This feature helps customers solve for multiple use cases. For example, customers can create an application that automatically remediates drift to CloudFormation stacks or create alerting applications that send notifications when developers make unintended changes to CloudFormation stacks. We look forward to the applications you build using this feature.

This feature is generally available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (N. California, Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong, Mumbai, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm), Middle East (Bahrain), and South America (SÃ£o Paulo). You can get started with a few clicks using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI commands of EventBridge. To learn more, visit CloudFormation [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks-event-bridge.html). These events are available for free in EventBridge.
