## Crypto Market Capital

Market capitalization is the total dollar value of all the shares of a company’s stock or, in the case of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, of all the coins that have been mined. 

In crypto, market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have been mined by the price of a single coin at any given time.

Market Cap = Price (X times) Circulating Supply

Even though the market cap of a project is still seen as the most important indicator of relevancy, the concept behind this is often subject to criticism. The reason is that the market cap of a cryptocurrency more or less reflects the popularity of a coin over a longer term. 

**Large-cap** cryptocurrencies are generally considered to be safe crypto investments. These are companies with a market cap of more than $10 billion. Investing in coins with large market capitalization is usually a conservative strategy. These coins are likely to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies but still more volatile than traditional assets like stocks.

**Mid-cap** cryptos are more volatile but also have a lot more growth potential than large-cap cryptocurrencies.

**Small-cap** cryptocurrencies are often extremely volatile and considered a highly risky investment, albeit sometimes with a lot of potential short-term growth. However, be aware that they may also crash, literally from one minute to the next.

Price is just one way to measure a cryptocurrency’s value. Investors use market cap to tell a more complete story and compare value across cryptocurrencies. As a key statistic, it can indicate the growth potential of a cryptocurrency and whether it is safe to buy, compared to others.
