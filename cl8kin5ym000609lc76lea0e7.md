## AWS IoT FleetWise is now generally available

AWS IoT FleetWise is now generally available to help automotive companies collect, transform, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud in near real time. Automotive companies can use the data in the cloud to extensively analyze vehicle fleet health. Insights gained allow companies to quickly identify potential maintenance issues, make in-vehicle infotainment systems smarter, or use analytics and machine learning (ML) to improve autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

Automakers, suppliers, fleet operators, and technology solution vendors in the automotive industry can use AWS IoT FleetWise to collect and organize vehicle data, and store the data in a standardized way for analysis in the cloud. With AWS IoT FleetWise intelligent data collection controls, you can limit the amount of data transferred to the cloud by creating conditional rules (for example, sensor data from hard-braking events associated with a vehicle make and model). 

AWS IoT FleetWise with standard vehicle data collection is generally available today in US East (N. Virginia) and Europe (Frankfurt), with availability in additional AWS Regions coming soon.
