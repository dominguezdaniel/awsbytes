## Announcing Amazon Neptune Global Database

[Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) now supports Global Database, allowing a single Neptune database to span multiple AWS Regions to provide disaster recovery in case of region-wide outages and enable low-latency global reads for applications with a global footprint. Neptune Global Database is available in the US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) regions.

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. Neptune Global Database uses fast, storage-based replication across regions with latencies typically less than one second, using dedicated infrastructure with no impact to your workload’s performance. In the unlikely event of a regional degradation or outage, one of the secondary regions can be promoted to full read/write capabilities. You can have up-to five secondary regions with global database, and each secondary region can have up-to 16 replica instances.

You can create a Neptune Global Database with just a few clicks on the Amazon Neptune [Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/) or download the latest [AWS SDK or CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/neptune/index.html). For Neptune Global Database, standard pricing will apply for the Neptune resources you use in all AWS Regions. Additionally, you will be charged for ‘replicated write I/Os', which will capture writes, inserts, and deletes between the primary and secondary Neptune clusters. For more information on Neptune Global Database, visit our [documentation](documentation). For pricing please see [Amazon Neptune pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) page.
