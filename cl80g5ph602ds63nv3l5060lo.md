## Amazon SWF launches new console experience

[Amazon SWF](https://aws.amazon.com/swf/) has launched a new console experience, making it easier for you to manage SWF workflows with more visibility and control.

Amazon SWF is a workflow service that makes it easier for you to build distributed applications. You have full control over the implementation and coordination of tasks and Amazon SWF manages the underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state. You can run your application on-premise, or on Amazon EC2, a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

The new console experience for Amazon SWF provides improved visibility of your SWF domains, a way of scoping Amazon SWF resources within your AWS account, as well as more information about workflow executions and their events. You can search and filter executions and events using properties such as execution ID, workflow, type, and output. The new console makes it easier for you to manage high volume workloads and quickly find the detailed information you need to operate efficiently.

The new console experience for Amazon SWF is now available in all regions where Amazon SWF is available. To learn more, visit the [Amazon SWF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-welcome.html).
