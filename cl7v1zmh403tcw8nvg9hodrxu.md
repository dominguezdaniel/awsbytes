## AWS Security Hub launches a new security best practice control

[AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) has launched a new control for its [Foundational Security Best Practice standard (FSBP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp.html) to enhance your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). This control conducts fully-automatic checks against security best practices for AWS Auto Scaling. If you have Security Hub set to automatically enable new controls and are already using AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, the control is enabled for you automatically. Security Hub now supports 224 security controls to automatically check your security posture in AWS.

The new [FSBP control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html) that we launched is [AutoScaling.9] Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups should use EC2 launch templates.

[Available globally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-regions.html), AWS Security Hub gives you a centralized and comprehensive view of your security posture across all of your AWS accounts and across all Regions. With Security Hub, you now have a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS IAM Access Analyzer, as well as from over [65 AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/). You can also continuously monitor your environment using automated security checks based on standards, such as AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. You can also take action on these findings by investigating findings in Amazon Detective and by using Amazon CloudWatch Event rules to send the findings to ticketing, chat, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR), and incident management tools or custom remediation playbooks.
You can enable your 30-day free trial of AWS Security Hub with a single-click in the AWS Management console. Please see the AWS Regions page for all the regions where AWS Security Hub is available.
