## Amazon QuickSight launches new base maps for geospatial visualizations

QuickSight Authors can now customize the look and feel of their maps by changing to any of the new base maps supported by Amazon QuickSight.

Streets - Authors can now add location details with streets base map. This base map emphasizes legible styling for highways, major roads, minor roads, railways, water features, cities, parks, landmarks, building footprints, and administrative boundaries.

Dark gray canvas - Authors can now choose between light (existing base) and dark (new) gray canvas letting them align maps to the overall style of the dashboard. With minimal colors, labels, and features, dark gray canvas base map is designed to draw attention to your data.

Imagery - Authors can choose to add more visual context to their map by choosing the Imagery base map. The satellite view of the world will help authors increase the understanding of the location data.

The new base maps are available for both points on map or filled map visuals. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/base-maps.html) for more details.

We have partnered with Amazon Location Service to power all the base maps on Amazon QuickSight. Amazon Location Service is a location-based service that makes it easy for developers to add maps, points of interest, geocoding, routing, tracking, and geofencing to their applications without sacrificing data security and user privacy.

Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), South America (SÃ£o Paulo), and AWS GovCloud (US-West).
