# Announcing dark mode support in the AWS Management Console

AWS launches dark mode as a beta feature in the AWS Management Console. Dark mode is available as a setting for visual mode in Unified Settings. The setting persists for customers across browsers and devices.

Dark mode helps reduce eye strain and provides contrast in bright environments which improves readability and accessibility. Dark mode also improves navigation across user interfaces and reduces energy consumption on some devices.

In Unified Settings, you can choose between three settings for visual mode: browser default, dark, and light. Browser default applies the default dark or light setting of the browser, dark applies the new built-in dark mode, and light maintains the current look and feel of the AWS Console. You can select dark mode in Unified Settings by [logging into the AWS Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/), selecting the account menu, and selecting Settings.
