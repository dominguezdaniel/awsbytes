# Amazon Neptune Serverless is now generally available

Amazon Neptune Serverless is a new deployment option that automatically scales capacity based on the needs of the application, making it easy and cost effective for developers to run graph databases without managing database capacity. Neptune is a fast, reliable, and fully managed graph database service for building and running applications with highly connected datasets, such as knowledge graphs, fraud graphs, identity graphs, and security graphs. With Neptune Serverless, you can run applications built using a graph database with a just few steps, and scale automatically to meet your application’s needs.

If you have unpredictable and variable workloads, Neptune Serverless automatically determines and provisions the compute and memory resources to run the graph database. Database capacity scales up and down based on the application’s changing requirements to maintain consistent performance, saving up to 90% in database costs compared to provisioning at peak capacity. With Neptune Serverless, you create a graph database for your application, using the three most popular graph query languages: Apache TinkerPop Gremlin, openCypher, and SPARQL.

Neptune Serverless is now available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London). 

You can create a Neptune Serverless cluster from the [Amazon Neptune console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/neptune), AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDK, with support for AWS CloudFormation coming soon.
