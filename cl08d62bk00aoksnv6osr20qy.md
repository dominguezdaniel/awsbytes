## eBay Might Integrate Crypto Payments

The e-commerce giant aims to become the marketplace for Millennials and Gen Z, and given their rising interests in crypto, add new payment options to lure in the customer base.

The rise in popularity and demand for cryptocurrencies has made several online platforms add crypto payments options. 

A slew of surveys shows that millennials tend to be the most crypto-friendly demographic, which explains eBay's upcoming pivot to crypto.

eBay was exploring Bitcoin payment integration last year as well along with NFT trading.  Transactions related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were taking place on eBay while the company had not made any particular announcement.

The crypto payment integration plan now seems to be near finalized as crypto has become mainstream and more acceptable among the masses.
