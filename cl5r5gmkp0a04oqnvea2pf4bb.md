[Amazon Timestream](https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/) will no longer charge customers for the dimension names and measure names associated with ingesting, storing, and querying data written after July 8, 2022 00:00 UTC. Dimension names and measure names are metadata that is used to identify time series data. With this change, Amazon Timestream provides customers increased flexibility in dimension and measure naming, as well as improved cost-effectiveness of the service. Amazon Timestream will continue to charge for ingesting, storing, and querying the dimension values, measure values, and timestamps associated with time series data.

Amazon Timestream is a fast, serverless, secure, and purpose-built time series database for analytics, DevOps, and IoT applications that can scale to process trillions of time series events per day.

The purpose-built query engine lets you access and analyze recent and historical data across these tiers. Additionally, visualizing your data is simple with integration and connector support through Amazon Quicksight, Grafana, and JDBC. Amazon Timestream also automatically scales up or down to adjust capacity and performance, so you don’t need to manage the underlying infrastructure, freeing you to focus on building your applications.
