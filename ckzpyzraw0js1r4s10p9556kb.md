## 5 Blockchain Platforms You Need To Know

With the ongoing evolution of the crypto industry from default reliance on a few dominating blockchains to a surplus of emerging platforms, this is an exciting time to develop, grow, and support your blockchain of choice. One of the central values of the crypto industry is an individual’s freedom to choose which blockchain systems they want to back. 

Below five of the platforms that have risen in the crypto market cap ranks and made substantial progress with their technology and communities:

**1- Binance Chain (BNB)**
Total Market Cap (July 14, 2021): $45.310 billion (Rank #4)

Peak Market Cap: $103.672 billion

YTD Growth: 727.77%

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a fairly recent smart contract blockchain, introduced in late August 2020. BSC was created as a parallel blockchain to Binance Chain, which launched in April 2020 to facilitate decentralized trading. Before BNB transitioned into being the native token of Binance Chain, it was an ERC-20 token created in 2017 alongside the market-leading exchange Binance.

BSC boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), combined with the blockchain’s high throughput and 3-second block times. This means that Ethereum-native applications can conveniently switch over to BSC and take advantage of the faster speeds and lower fees.

Combined with Ethereum's recent network challenges, BSC’s attributes have made it an attractive option for blockchain applications to easily switch over. BSC processed 11.8 million transactions in a day at its peak, multiple times the maximum volume on Ethereum. As a crypto asset, BNB rose to as high as Top 3 in the crypto rankings, driven by the combination of BSC’s momentum, the growing number of use cases for the token, and its use as a utility token on the Binance exchange, the largest exchange in the world by trading volume, among other factors.

**2- Polygon (MATIC)**
Total Market Cap (July 14, 2021): $5.608 billion (Rank #17)

Peak Market Cap: $15.084 billion

Year-to-Date (YTD) Growth: 6,443.85%

We begin the list with a blockchain platform that is actually supplementary to Ethereum’s growth. Polygon, which started out as a Binance Launchpad project named Matic in April 2019, offers a protocol for creating Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. The Polygon Network serves as an Ethereum sidechain, or a parallel chain connected to Ethereum, that offers faster speeds and very low costs. The platform allows developers to easily launch Ethereum-compatible scaling solutions and stand-alone blockchains as part of a network of interconnecting blockchains.

Polygon, which calls itself Ethereum’s Internet of Blockchains, is now used by many popular DeFi apps such as Aave, Curve, and Sushi, as well as native applications like QuickSwap and Slingshot. The platform also benefits from an investment and endorsement from well-known entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who noted that the network’s user base is “growing exponentially.”

The Polygon (MATIC) token is used to pay for gas fees on its namesake network and participate in the protocol’s governance.

**3- Solana (SOL)**
Total Market Cap (July 14, 2021): $7.663 billion (Rank #14)

Peak Market Cap: $15.243 billion

YTD Growth: 8,833.09%

Solana’s blockchain network prioritizes fast transactions in a novel trustless system called Proof of History. Unlike blockchain validation mechanisms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, which build consensus with other nodes in the blockchain system, Proof of History creates a long, unbroken chain of hashed transactions that do not require a conventional timestamp. This process makes it possible for the Solana blockchain to process transactions faster, up to 50,000 transactions per second.

Notable integrations with Solana this year include the project’s tie-up with Chainlink at the start of 2021 and chat app Kik’s migration of its Kin tokens to Solana last year. In June, Solana raised $314 million from noted Silicon Valley investor Andressen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, which sees the project as a complement to Ethereum.

The Solana (SOL) token works as the blockchain’s utility token, used for transaction fees related to transfers and the use of smart contracts. While SOL only started trading in notable exchanges in April 2020, the blockchain was actually created way back in 2017. 

**4- Polkadot (DOT)**
Total Market Cap (July 14, 2021): $13.082 billion (Rank #7)

Peak Market Cap: $45.661 billion

YTD Growth: 64.55%

Similar to the first two blockchains mentioned in this article, Polkadot aims to interconnect multiple blockchains into one universal network. What sets Polkadot apart is its focus on building infrastructure for Web 3.0, the evolution of Internet technology through the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Polkadot, led by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, connects parachains (parallel blockchains) to the main Relay Chain, allowing for the easy exchange of information at all times.

Earlier this year, institutional investors such as Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan, and UBS have reportedly bought shares in Polkadot’s exchange-traded product (ETP), which is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. While this doesn’t mean that the institutions own DOT tokens, the ETP investment signifies interest in Polkadot’s future.

While Polkadot’s YTD growth pales in comparison to the previous two projects, it’s important to note that Polkadot’s market cap was already between $3 billion and $5 billion in the first four months when it started trading in September 2020. 

**5- Cardano (ADA)**
Total Market Cap (July 14, 2021): $39.163 billion (Rank #5)

Peak Market Cap: $73.772 billion

YTD Growth: 617.85%

One of the earlier blockchain platforms in the list, Cardano was created in 2015 as a third-generation, general-purpose blockchain that emphasizes scalability and an eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake system. Designed based on peer-reviewed academic research, Cardano is developed mainly by the technology company Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), founded by Charles Hoskinson, who worked on Ethereum in its early days. Recently, Cardano completed a hard fork upgrade that paves the way for smart contract integrations on the blockchain.

Cardano is perceived as one of the main rival blockchains to Ethereum, driving its rise to the Top 5 in cryptocurrency rankings. Driven by retail investment and corporate partnerships such as its recent tie-up with Swiss blockchain firm Lykke Corp, blockchain activity on Cardano rose from 418,000 transactions at the start of the year to as much as 1.6 million in May. Nevertheless, Cardano’s proponents are taking a long-term view on its development, with a roadmap that extends all the way to 2025.
