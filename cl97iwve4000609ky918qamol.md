# Monitor Amazon EMR Serverless jobs in real-time with native Spark and Hive Tez UI

AWS announces that you can now monitor and debug jobs in EMR Serverless using native Apache Spark & Hive Tez UIs. The Apache Spark & Hive Tez UIs present visual interfaces with detailed information about your running and completed jobs. You can dive into job-specific metrics and information about event timelines, stages, tasks, and executors for each job. 

After you submit a job to an EMR Serverless application, you can view the real-time Spark UI or the Hive Tez UI for the running job from the EMR Studio console or request a secure URL using the GetDashboardForJobRun API. For completed jobs, you can view the Spark History Server or the Persistent Hive Tez UI from the EMR Studio Console.

To learn more and get started, please see the Monitoring EMR Serverless applications and jobs documentation in the Amazon EMR Serverless User Guide. Real-time job monitoring is available at no additional charge in all the regions where Amazon EMR Serverless is available.
