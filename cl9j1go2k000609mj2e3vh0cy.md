# AWS Nitro Enclaves is now supported on AWS Graviton

AWS Nitro Enclaves is available on AWS Graviton2 and AWS Graviton3 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. With this launch, Nitro Enclaves is supported on the majority of Graviton, Intel, and AMD-based Amazon EC2 instance types built on the AWS Nitro System.

[AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/) is an Amazon EC2 capability that enables customers to create isolated compute environments (enclaves) to further protect and securely process highly sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), healthcare, financial, and intellectual property data within their Amazon EC2 instances. Nitro Enclaves helps customers reduce the attack surface area for their most sensitive data processing applications.

Customers familiar with the price performance benefits of Graviton and require an isolated compute environment, can now create those enclaves on Graviton-based instances. AWS Graviton processors are designed by AWS to deliver the best price performance for your cloud workloads running in EC2. Customers using Graviton2-based instances have experienced significant price performance benefits. AWS Graviton3 processors are the latest in the AWS Graviton processor family and Graviton3-based C7g instances provide up to 25% better compute performance and up to 2x faster cryptographic workload performance compared to AWS Graviton2-based instances. There are no additional charges for using Nitro Enclaves other than the use of EC2 instances and any other AWS services that are used with Nitro Enclaves.

Nitro Enclaves is supported on the following Graviton-based instance types, C7g, C6g, C6gd, C6gn, M6g, M6gd, R6g, R6gd, and X2gd, with more instance types coming soon. To view the current list of supported instance types and supported AWS regions, see the [Nitro Enclaves documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html).
