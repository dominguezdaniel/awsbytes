## Amazon QuickSight adds Bookmarks in dashboards

[Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) now supports Bookmarks in dashboards. Bookmarks allow QuickSight readers to save customized dashboard preferences into a list of Bookmarks for easy one-click access to specific views of the dashboard without having to manually make multiple filter and parameter changes every time. Combined with QuickSight’s “Share this view” functionality, readers can also now share their Bookmark views with other readers for easy collaboration and discussion. Bookmarks are available to all users of the QuickSight console interface. For further details, visit [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/dashboard-bookmarks.html).

The new Bookmarks functionality is available in Amazon QuickSight Standard and Enterprise Editions in all QuickSight regions - US East (Ohio and N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland and London), South America (São Paulo) and AWS GovCloud (US-West).
