## Amazon Corretto 19 is now generally available

Amazon Corretto 19 is now generally available. This version supports the latest OpenJDK feature release and is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS. You can download Corretto 19 from our downloads page.

Highlights of OpenJDK 19 include previews of [Record Patterns](https://openjdk.org/jeps/405), a new [Foreign Function & Memory API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/424), and [Virtual Threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/425). Developers will get improved data navigation using Record Pattern Matching, which offers more sophisticated, composable data queries. Also in preview in this release is a Foreign Function & Memory API, which will allow you to more easily interoperate with native code outside the JVM, and Virtual Threading, which will improve the developer experience when writing, maintaining and observing high-throughput concurrent applications.

There is a new incubating feature for [Structured Concurrency](https://openjdk.org/jeps/428). Plus, you will get updates to the [Pattern Matching for switch statements](https://openjdk.org/jeps/427) preview feature and to the incubating [Vector API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/426). Structured Concurrency will streamline error handling and cancellation, improve reliability, and enhance observability by treating multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work.
