## Announcing Cloudscape Design System, an open source solution for building intuitive web applications

AWS announced [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/), an open source solution for building intuitive, engaging, and inclusive user experiences at scale. Cloudscape consists of an extensive set of guidelines to create web applications, along with the design resources and front-end components to streamline implementation.
Cloudscape was built for and is used by AWS products and services. AWS created it in 2016 to improve the user experience across AWS web applications, and also to help teams implement those applications faster. Since then, they continued enhancing the system based on customer feedback and research. If you’ve ever used the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), you’ve seen Cloudscape in action.

AWS is releasing Cloudscape as open source so that anyone building cloud products can benefit from our design system, and also join a community of designers and developers who continually improve it. Whether you’re building a product that extends the AWS Management Console, designing a user interface for a hybrid cloud management system, or setting up an on-premises solution that uses AWS, Cloudscape offers a solid base of 60+ components, 30+ pattern guidelines, and 20+ demos to make your work easier. To customize your user experience, Cloudscape offers theming, dark mode, and content density modes.
