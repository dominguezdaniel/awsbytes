## Amazon Connect launches updated flows UI and improved flow language

Amazon Connect now has an updated [flow designer](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/09/amazon-connect-updated-flows-ui-improved-flow-language/) UI, that makes it easier and faster to build personalized and automated end-customer experiences. With this launch, you can now easily filter the available blocks to quickly find what you need to build the flow, create color coded connections between blocks, view additional block metadata (e.g., the full text prompt in the Play Prompt block) at a glance, and [more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-release-notes.html). Additionally, with the improved [flow language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/flow-language.html), you can now [import and export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/contact-flow-import-export.html) flows in your Amazon Connect instance making it easy to interchangeably build and edit between the UI and APIs.

This new feature is available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect is available. In Asia Pacific (Sydney) and Asia Pacific (Tokyo), the new experience is available by default. In all other regions, to opt-in to this experience, click the link in the banner on the Flows page in the Amazon Connect web application.
