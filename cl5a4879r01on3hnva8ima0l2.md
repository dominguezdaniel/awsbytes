## Amazon RDS Performance Insights supports additional performance history retention periods

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Performance Insights now allows you to choose retention periods for your performance history that range from one month up to 24 months. You can also use the RDS Performance Insights free tier, which includes seven days of performance data history and one million API requests per month. We have also adjusted the pricing model, resulting in reduced pricing of 24-month retention for most instance types.

RDS Performance Insights allows non-experts to measure database performance with a simple-to-understand dashboard that visualizes database load. With one click, you can add a fully managed performance monitoring solution to your Amazon Aurora clusters and Amazon RDS instances. RDS Performance Insights automatically gathers necessary performance metrics and visualizes them in a dynamic dashboard on the RDS console. You can identify your databaseâ€™s top performance bottlenecks from a single graph.

To get started, log into the [Amazon RDS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home) and enable Amazon RDS Performance Insights when creating or modifying an instance of a supported Amazon RDS engine. Then go to the Amazon RDS Performance Insights dashboard to start monitoring performance. Existing RDS Performance Insights can change the retention window for their databases using the modify database flow.
