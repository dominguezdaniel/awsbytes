# Amazon Connect Wisdom now delivers improved machine learning capabilities

Amazon Connect Wisdom now delivers improved machine learning capabilities to continuously understand issues throughout a call and to deliver the right knowledge article to contact center agents. Wisdom analyzes contact center calls in real-time and proactively delivers agents the information they need to solve customer issues, improving agent productivity and caller satisfaction.
 
With these enhancements that were developed after training machine learning models on hundreds of thousands of contacts, Wisdom is able to more accurately distinguish a caller's issue from the rest of the conversation and continuously detects new issues a caller may raise (for example, distinguishing pleasantries such as “we got a lot of snow this weekend” from weather-related issues such as “my flight was cancelled because of snow and I need to be re-booked”). In addition, Wisdom's new machine learning models have a deeper, semantic understanding of the issues detected and how they relate to your organization's own knowledge articles (for example, if your knowledge articles only refer to “potential fraud” and a caller asks about or an agent manually searches for “unauthorized charge,” Wisdom can understand those terms refer to the same thing and return the most relevant article for the issue.). 

Amazon Connect Wisdom is available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (London), Europe (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) AWS regions.
