## Gucci buys land in The Sandbox to create experiences in the Metaverse

[Gucci](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/gucci-plans-virtual-world-for-gen-z-on-sandbox) is redoubling its commitment to the metaverse.

The designer clothing brand announced on Wednesday that it has purchased an undisclosed amount of virtual land in decentralized blockchain game The Sandbox. Gucci will create themed experiences at The Sandbox inspired by its "Gucci Vault" platform, which lists items such as Gucci-themed NFTs and vintage handbags.

In addition to a fashion-focused metaverse space, Gucci will also release fashion items for The Sandbox players to purchase and wear in the game's VR.

This is not the first time that Gucci has licensed items for virtual use. It previously partnered with two Roblox developers to release an official clothing collection in December 2020. Gucci also created a virtual space on Roblox called "Gucci Garden Experience." Notably, some of the Roblox items ended up being resold and resold for thousands of dollars, with prices comparable to actual Gucci bags.

But unlike Roblox, The Sandbox is a clearly crypto-focused platform. Users must purchase virtual land and items using the SAND token, and the game itself is built on the Ethereum network. That said, The Sandbox is also no stranger to wild prices for virtual stuff, with buyers snapping up virtual real estate near virtual celebrity land for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Gucci, which made a name for itself in crypto as the first luxury brand to launch an NFT, a type of token used to prove ownership of digital items, continues to invest in decentralized platforms and assets, showing no signs of slowing down when it's about expanding into the world of Web3.
