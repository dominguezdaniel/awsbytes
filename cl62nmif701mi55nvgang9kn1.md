## AWS Config conformance packs now provide scores to help you track resource compliance

AWS Config now supports compliance scores as an enhancement to conformance packs. A compliance score is a percentage-based score that helps you quickly discern the level to which your resources are compliant for a set of requirements that are captured within the scope of a conformance pack. A conformance pack is a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions that can be easily deployed as a single entity in an AWS account or AWS Region, or across an organization in AWS Organizations.

A compliance score is calculated based on the number of rule-to-resource combinations that are compliant within the scope of a conformance pack. For example, a conformance pack with 5 rules applying to 5 resources has 25 (5x5) possible rule-resource combinations. If 2 resources are not compliant with 2 rules, the compliance score would be 84%, indicating that 21 out of 25 rule-resource combinations are currently in compliance. Further, compliance scores are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch metrics, which allows for tracking over time. Compliance scores offer a consistent measurement to track remediation progress, perform comparisons across different sets of requirements, and see the impact a specific change or deployment has on your compliance posture.

Compliance scores are part of conformance packs and are available in all AWS Regions where [AWS Config conformance packs are available](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html#conformance-packs-regions). AWS Config conformance packs follow a tiered pricing model based on the number of rule evaluations you run each month; compliance scores are available at no additional cost to this. To learn more about compliance scores and conformance pack pricing, visit the [AWS Config product page](https://aws.amazon.com/config/pricing/), or see the documentation on [Viewing the AWS Config Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/viewing-the-aws-config-dashboard.html) and [Viewing Compliance Data in the Conformance Packs Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-pack-dashboard.html).
