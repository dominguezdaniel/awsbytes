## Amazon S3 increases the maximum number of S3 Access Points and adds support for Amazon Redshift, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon SageMaker Feature Store

You can now create up to 10,000 Amazon S3 Access Points per region per account to manage granular access permissions across your different applications. In addition, access points now support Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon CloudFront, helping you use access point aliases directly with your applications as a replacement for S3 bucket names.

S3 Access Points help you more easily configure the right access controls for your shared datasets, simplifying access management for multiple applications. Each access point has its own policy that defines which requests and VPCs are allowed to use the access point. With up to 10,000 access points, you can now easily scale access management to thousands of use cases. For example, you can create access points with tailored read or write access for each team within your organization, or limit access to a bucket through access points that are restricted to a VPC.

Each of these S3 Access Points has an access point alias automatically generated that you can use to access your S3 data with AWS services such as Amazon EMR or Amazon Redshift. For example, with the added support for Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, your data scientists can manage Machine Learning (ML) features for their ML models using access points that give them access to the required data sets, without needing bucket policies.

You can use S3 Access Points with AWS services such as Amazon EMR, Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon CloudFront at no additional cost in all [AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/), excluding the Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet and Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD.
