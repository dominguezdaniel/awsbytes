## Amazon Connect Customer Profiles now supports Amazon AppFlow connectors

[Amazon Connect Customer Profiles](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/customer-profiles/) is now available as a destination in the Amazon AppFlow console. With a few clicks, customers can now bring data from 20+ application connectors into Customer Profiles and equip contact center agents with the information needed to provide personalized customer service. Amazon AppFlow connectors allows ingestion of data such as transactions (e.g., purchase orders from SAP OData), profile information (e.g., leads from Zendesk Sell) and customer interactions (e.g., Slack conversations) to create a single, unified profile for each of your customers.

You can prepare customer data for your specific contact center use cases by leveraging Amazon AppFlowâ€™s no-code console experience. For instance, hiding sensitive credit card information by using the masking feature or ingesting the data for a specific geography using the filter feature that transfers only the records that meet the filter criteria.

Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt) and Europe (London) Regions.
