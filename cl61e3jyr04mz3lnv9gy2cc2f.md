## Amazon RDS for MariaDB now supports R5b instances

[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MariaDB](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/) now supports R5b database (DB) instances. R5b DB instances support up to 3x the I/O operations per second (IOPS) and 3x the bandwidth on [Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) compared to the x86-based memory-optimized R5 DB instances. R5b DB instances are a great choice for IO-intensive DB workloads.

You can launch new R5b DB instances with a single click in the Amazon RDS Management Console or via a single command in the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). If you want to upgrade your existing Amazon RDS DB instance to R5b, you can do so on the [Modify DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html) page in the Amazon RDS Management Console or via the AWS CLI. Amazon RDS R5b DB instances are supported on MariaDB versions 10.3 and higher. For more details, refer to the [Amazon RDS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html).

R5b DB instances are available for Amazon RDS for MariaDB databases in the AWS US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Singapore, Tokyo) regions. They are offered in 8 sizes, providing up to 96 vCPUs, 768 GiB of memory, 25 Gbps of networking bandwidth, and 60 Gbps of [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) bandwidth.
