# Spot Instance interruptions can now be tested directly from Amazon EC2 console via AWS Fault Injection Simulator integration

You can now inject [Amazon EC2 Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) Instance interruptions into your Spot Instance workloads directly from the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/). In 2021, we launched the ability for you to use [AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS)](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) to simulate what happens when Amazon EC2 reclaims Spot Instances, enabling you to test that your application is prepared for an interruption. Now, we have made this capability available in the Amazon EC2 console.

Spot Instances enable you to run compute workloads on Amazon EC2 at a discount in exchange for returning the Spot Instances [when Amazon EC2 needs the capacity back](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#specifying-spot-interruption-behavior). Because it is always possible that your Spot Instance may be interrupted, you should ensure that your application is prepared for a Spot Instance interruption. To trigger a Spot Instance interruption from the the Amazon EC2 console, you just need to navigate to the Spot Request section, select a Spot Instance request and then choose Actions, Initiate interruption. Behind the scenes, we then use AWS FIS to inject the interruption in your selected Spot Instance so that you can test how your application will react to a real-world interruption.

Initiating a Spot Instance interruption through the Amazon EC2 console is available in all AWS Regions except Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Osaka), China (Beijing, operated by Sinnet), and China (Ningxia, operated by NWCD) and Middle East (UAE). Initiating a Spot Instance interruption through the Amazon EC2 console is also available in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.
