## AWS Security Hub launches 36 new security best practice controls

[AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) has released 36 new controls for its [Foundational Security Best Practice standard (FSBP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp.html) to enhance your Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). These controls conduct fully-automatic checks against security best practices for AWS Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFormation, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon Kinesis, AWS Network Firewall, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), and AWS WAF. If you have Security Hub set to automatically enable new controls and are already using AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, these controls are enabled for you by default. Security Hub now supports 223 security controls to automatically check your security posture in AWS.

The 36 [FSBP controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html) launched are listed in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/doc-history.html).

[Available globally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-regions.html), AWS Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your security posture across your AWS accounts. With Security Hub, you now have a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS IAM Access Analyzer, as well as from over [65 AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/partners/). You can also continuously monitor your environment using automated security checks based on standards, such as AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. You can also take action on these findings by investigating findings in Amazon Detective and by using Amazon CloudWatch Event rules to send the findings to ticketing, chat, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR), and incident management tools or custom remediation playbooks.
