# AWS IoT Core announces Location Action to route location data from IoT devices to Amazon Location Service

[AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/) announces Location Action - a capability to route latitude and longitude data from IoT devices to [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/), making it easier for software developers to add geospatial data and location functionality to IoT applications. With this launch, you can route live location data of an IoT device to Amazon Location Service for tracking and geo-fencing use cases, such as tracking the live location of a device or receiving alerts when a device crosses a geo-fence.

AWS IoT Core is a fully managed service that allows you to connect billions of IoT devices and route trillions of messages to AWS services without managing cloud infrastructure. Rules Engine is a feature in AWS IoT Core that allows you to filter and process IoT device data and route the data to 15+ AWS and third party services. You can now use Rules Engine to filter and process latitude-longitude data from messages generated by IoT devices. You can then use the Location Action feature in Rules Engine to route the latitude-longitude data to Amazon Location Service, thus gaining the capability to track, record, and visualize IoT devices through Amazon Location Service.

To get started, connect your IoT devices to AWS IoT Core, define Rules to filter latitude-longitude data from your messages, and create a Location Action using Rules Engine console, CLI, or SDKs to monitor location data for your device.

The Location Action feature in AWS IoT Core is available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions .
