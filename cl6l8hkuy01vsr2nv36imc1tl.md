## Amazon QuickSight launches redesigned dashboard experience

[Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) launched a new look and feel for the dashboard experience. The new interface enhances the reader experience by improving the discoverability, predictability, and the overall polish of the dashboards. The new dashboard experience includes:

Simplified toolbar with updated icons for key actions for better visual clarity.

Discoverable visual menu visible on-hover to improve the discoverability of drills, export, and filter restatements.

New controls, menu, and submenus to provide a better visual experience.

Non-blocking right pane for secondary experiences like filters, threshold alerts, and downloads to improve focus on the content of the dashboard.

The new experience will also be available for customers using QuickSight in Embedding mode. See here for more details about the changes to expect with the new look.

Redesigned dashboard experience is now now available in all supported Amazon QuickSight regions - US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), South America (SÃ£o Paulo), and AWS GovCloud (US-West).
